# üè• Conceptual Framework for Integrated Healthcare Information Access Using Design Thinking Approach

A web-based application to manage hospital records, patient details, prescriptions, blood donor contacts, and test reports ‚Äî all in one place. This system bridges the communication gap between hospitals and patients by allowing hospitals to directly update medical records and patients to securely access them.

## üìê Design Thinking Approach

This project was developed using the **Design Thinking** methodology to ensure a user-centered and problem-solving approach. The five stages followed are:

### 1. Empathize
- Conducted user research with **patients** and **healthcare providers**.
- Identified challenges in:
  - Accessing hospital data
  - Retrieving prescriptions and test reports
  - Finding blood donors quickly during emergencies

### 2. Define
- Framed the core problem:
  > *"Patients struggle to access prescriptions, test reports, and blood donor contacts, especially in emergency or remote situations."*

### 3. Ideate
- Brainstormed and proposed solutions:
  - A unified **patient dashboard**
  - **Hospital-managed** prescription and report uploads
  - **Location-based** blood donor search functionality

### 4. Prototype
- Created **low- and high-fidelity wireframes** using **Figma**
- Developed a working prototype with:
  - Login system
  - Patient dashboard
  - Hospital listings
  - Blood donor contact integration

### 5. Test
- Performed testing with sample users to validate:
  - Dashboard usability
  - Ease of finding hospitals and donors
  - Download and filtering functionality for medical records
